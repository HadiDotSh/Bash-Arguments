# Bash Arguments

#### An easy to reuse bash script to use arguments in your own scripts.

### Install :
<p>Simply past this line in your shell :</p>

```bash
https://github.com/HadiDotSh/Bash-Arguments
```

### add it to your scripts

<p>I'm tired so I'm lazy to explain how it works, but this script allows you to grab the arguments and play with them. It's up to you to understand how it works (It's not very complicated)</p>
